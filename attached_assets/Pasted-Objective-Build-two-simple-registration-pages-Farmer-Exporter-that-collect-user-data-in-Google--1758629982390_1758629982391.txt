Design & UX Notes
	•	Simple layout: Big buttons, readable fonts, green (farmers) / blue (exporters) accents.
	•	Mobile-first design: Most farmers will use phones.
	•	Clear CTA buttons: “Submit Registration”
	•	Optional progress indicator for multi-step forms

⸻

Technical Implementation Suggestions
	•	Form → Google Sheets: Use Google Forms API, SheetDB, or AppScript to directly push data.
	•	WhatsApp Notification:
	•	Use WhatsApp Business API or services like Twilio WhatsApp API / 360dialog.
	•	Trigger message automatically when form is submitted.
	•	No backend needed at this stage — just forms + Google Sheets + WhatsApp integration.
